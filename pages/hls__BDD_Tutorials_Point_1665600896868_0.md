	- Providing a shared process and shared tools promoting communication to the software developers, business analysts and stakeholders to collaborate on software development, with the aim of delivering product with business value. What a system should do and not on how it should be implemented. Providing better readability and visibility. Verifying not only the working of the software but also that it meets the customer’s expectations.
- The need of the hour is a development approach that − Is based on the requirements. Focuses on requirements throughout the development. Ensures that the requirements are met.

- Behavior Driven Development − Derives examples of different expected behaviors of the system. Enables writing the examples in a language using the business domain terms to ensure easy understanding by everyone involved in the development including the customers. Gets the examples ratified with customer from time to time by means of conversations. Focuses on the customer requirements (examples) throughout the development. Uses examples as acceptance tests.

- unless requirements are obtained correctly, it would be expensive to fix the defects resulting from misunderstanding the requirements at a later stage. Further, the end product may not meet the customer’s expectations.

- Test Driven Development Test Driven Development, in the context of BDD, turns examples into human readable, executable specifications. The developers use these specifications as a guide to implement increments of new functionality. This, results in a lean codebase and a suite of automated regression tests that keep the maintenance costs low throughout the lifetime of the software.
