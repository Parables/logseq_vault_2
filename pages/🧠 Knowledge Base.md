- As far as Software Development is concerned, there is a lot of thins to learn and use in order to build a software today.
- It is not about writing codes anymore:
	- First, you have to decide which platform/environment your software would support
	- Then you decide on the language/tools you would use
	- But it doesn't end there. You have to consider also:
		- [[🧠 Knowledge Base/🏗️ Software Architecture]] #software-architecture
		- [[🧠 Knowledge Base/📐 Design Patterns]] #design-patterns
		- Version Control System #vcs
		- Software Security #software-security
		- [[🧠 Knowledge Base/Software Automation]] #software-automation
		- Life-cycle Management #life-cycle
		- Testing #testing
		- Release Management #release-management
-
- And as developers, we really want to make our lives simple, so we create packages, tools, plugins, frameworks and even languages all in the name of simplicity
- This Knowledge Base #kb will be used to keep track of my adventures as I explore the world of Software Development and all the amazing discoveries I will make
- It will consist of the following resources:
	- [[🧠 Knowledge Base/🗒️Learning Resources]] #articles
	- Videos #video-tutorials
	- Packages #packages
	- [[🧠 Knowledge Base/🛠️ Dev Tools]] #dev-tools
	- [[🧠 Knowledge Base/🛠️ Conf-Talks]] #conf-talks
	-

- I will explore all these tools/languages/frameworks/products and make reviews & tutorials about them on YouTube on a new Channel named TechXplora #techXplora
- By doing that, I hope to achieve the following:
	- Shed a spotlight on some amazing tools that hasn't gain popularity yet
	- Advertise very useful SAAS and become an influencer/product ambassador for such products
	- Help developers decide which tools to use for their projects
	- Earn some income from commissions and referals
	- Gather a community of people interested in my adventurers
- While I intend of making money doing this, I have to know how to respect their privacy
- This is a collection of tools that automate certain stages in the Software Development Lifecycle
