- The software has also gotten much more performant. We can do things today that we could scarcely dream about in the 1960s. The Forbin Project, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, and 2001: A Space Odyssey all tried to imagine our current future, but missed the mark rather significantly. They all imagined huge machines that gained sentience. What we have instead are impossibly small machines that are still ... just machines.{xx}

- If I took a computer programmer from 1966 forward in time to 2016 and put her1 in front of my MacBook running IntelliJ and showed her Java, she might need 24 hours to recover from the shock. But then she would be able to write the code. Java just isn’t that different from C, or even from Fortran.

- And if I transported you back to 1966 and showed you how to write and edit PDP-8 code by punching paper tape on a 10 character per second teletype, you might need24 hours to recover from the disappointment. But then you would be able to write the code. The code just hasn’t changed that much

- That’s the secret: This changelessness of the code is the reason that the rules of software architecture are so consistent across system types. The rules of software architecture are the rules of ordering and assembling the building blocks of programs. And since those building blocks are universal and haven’t changed, the rules for ordering them are likewise universal and changeless.

- Getting it right is another matter entirely. Getting software right is hard. It takes knowledge and skills that most young programmers haven’t yet acquired. It requires thought and insight that most programmers don’t take the time to develop. It requires a level of discipline and dedication that most programmers never dreamed they’d need. Mostly, it takes a passion for the craft and the desire to be a professional.

  When software is done right, it requires a fraction of the human resources to create and maintain. Changes are simple and rapid. Defects are few and far between. Effort is minimized, and functionality and flexibility are maximized. 
  
  Yes, this vision sounds a bit utopian. But I’ve been there; I’ve seen it happen. I’ve worked in projects where the design and architecture of the system made it easy to write and easy to maintain. I’ve experienced projects that required a fraction of the anticipated human resources. I’ve worked on systems that had extremely low defect rates. I’ve seen the extraordinary effect that good software architecture can have on a system, a project, and a team. I’ve been to the promised land.
- But don’t take my word for it. Look at your own experience. Have you experienced the opposite? Have you worked on systems that are so interconnected and intricately coupled that every change, regardless of how trivial, takes weeks and involves huge risks? Have you experienced the impedance of bad code and rotten design? Has the design of the systems you’ve worked on had a huge negative effect on the morale of the team, the trust of the customers, and the patience of the managers? Have you seen teams, departments, and even companies that have been brought down by the rotten structure of their software? Have you been to programming hell?

- There has been a lot of confusion about design and architecture over the years. What is design? What is architecture? What are the differences between the two?

  One of the goals of this book is to cut through all that confusion and to define, once and for all, what design and architecture are. For starters, I’ll assert that there is no difference between them. None at all. 
  
  The word “architecture” is often used in the context of something at a high level that is divorced from the lower-level details, whereas “design” more often seems to imply structures and decisions at a lower level. But this usage is nonsensical when you look at what a real architect does.
- The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.

- The measure of design quality is simply the measure of the effort required to meet the needs of the customer. If that effort is low, and stays low throughout the lifetime of the system, the design is good. If that effort grows with each new release, the design is bad. It’s as simple as that.

- When systems are thrown together in a hurry, when the sheer number of programmers is the sole driver of output, and when little or no thought is given to the cleanliness of the code or the structure of the design, then you can bank on riding this curve to its ugly end.

- From the developers’ point of view, this is tremendously frustrating, because everyone is working hard. Nobody has decreased their effort. And yet, despite all their heroics, overtime, and dedication, they simply aren’t getting much of anything done anymore. All their effort has been diverted away from features and is now consumed with managing the mess. Their job, such as it is, has changed into moving the mess from one place to the next, and the next, and the next, so that they can add one more meager little feature.

- Nearly 2600 years ago, Aesop told the story of the Tortoise and the Hare. The moral of that story has been stated many times in many different ways:

	- “Slow and steady wins the race.”
	- “The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.”
	- “The more haste, the less speed.”
	- The story itself illustrates the foolishness of overconfidence. The Hare, so confident in its intrinsic speed, does not take the race seriously, and so naps while the Tortoise crosses the finish line.
- But a part of their brain does sleep—the part that knows that good, clean, well-designed code matters.

- These developers buy into a familiar lie: “We can clean it up later; we just have to get to market first!” Of course, things never do get cleaned up later, because market pressures never abate. Getting to market first simply means that you’ve now got a horde of competitors on your tail, and you have to stay ahead of them by running as fast as you can.

- The bigger lie that developers buy into is the notion that writing messy code makes them go fast in the short term, and just slows them down in the long term. Developers who accept this lie exhibit the hare’s overconfidence in their ability to switch modes from making messes to cleaning up messes sometime in the future, but they also make a simple error of fact. The fact is that making messes is always slower than staying clean, no matter which time scale you are using.

- To take software architecture seriously, you need to know what good software architecture is. To build a system with a design and an architecture that minimize effort and maximize productivity, you need to know which attributes of system architecture lead to that end.

- Every software system provides two different values to the stakeholders: behavior and structure. Software developers are responsible for ensuring that both those values remain high. Unfortunately, they often focus on one to the exclusion of the other. Even more unfortunately, they often focus on the lesser of the two values, leaving the software system eventually valueless.

- The second value of software has to do with the word “software”—a compound word composed of “soft” and “ware.” The word “ware” means “product”; the word“soft”... Well, that’s where the second value lies.

  **Software was invented to be “soft.” It was intended to be a way to easily change the behavior of machines.** If we’d wanted the behavior of machines to be hard to change, we would have called it hardware.
