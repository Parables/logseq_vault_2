- Summary: 
  Designed after the social organization of wolves in packs, there is an Alpha male who calls the shots and directs the pack. The next in command is the Beta who may act in the absence of the Alpha but with one big exception: All members of the pack are treated equally and each seen as his/her own master

- Motivation:
	- There are lots of opportunity in the tech industry.
	- A lot of companies need the people with the tech experience and skills to build the business.
	- Startups and small-medium sized companies can't afford the professional services of developers
	- There are lots of gigs out there that are not being worked on due to the lack of developers
	- Lots of kids lack the orientation about the possibilities of technology, esp in Ghana and our rural areas
