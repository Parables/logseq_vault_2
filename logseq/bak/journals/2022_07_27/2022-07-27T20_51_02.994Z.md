- [[Event Sourcing]] vs [[Event Driven]] 
  Event sourcing is mainly concerned on how the state in an application is persisted. Instead of perisisting the  data as the current state of the application, Event Sourcing persists the actual events that were emitted during a process and those events are replayed to derive the application state.
  
  Event Driving on the other hand is more concerned about the events that are published by an application. Consumers subscribe to these emitted events and so that they can react to these events. #fleeting #concepts #[[Software Architecture]]
