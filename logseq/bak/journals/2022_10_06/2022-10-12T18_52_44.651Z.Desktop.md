- [[Dear Dairy]] Code Signal Practise Test
	- As part of Amalitech's application process, I have to take a coding assement latest by tomorrow
	  DEADLINE: <2022-10-7 Fri>
	- I decided to start with the practise tests and here are some highlights:
		- I don't know BODMAS:
			- NOW Make a YouTube video about this

			- ❌ All this while, I thought `BODMAS` means Bracket Of Division Multiplication Addition and Subtraction and that you will do Brackets first, before Multiplication, before Division, before Multiplication, before Addition and finally do the Subtraction. This is what I remembered being taught to me in my primary school.
			- ✅ `BODMAS` actually means Bracket Orders/Powers/Exponents Division Multiplication  and Subtraction and that you do
			- 1. 🌘 🌒 `Brackets` first
			  2. ⬇️ evaluate any `Orders`(exponents/powers) form up to down manner  ⬇️
			  3. ➡️ `Division` and `Multiplication` are in the same rank so evaluate the expressions  in order of appearance from left to right. ➡️
			  4. ➡️ Likewise, `Addition` and `Subtractions` are also on the same rank so evaluate the expressions in order of appearance from left to right ➡️
			  5.
		- I never knew about [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Element) until now. Supported in Firefox and Safari browsers as at now
			- NOW Make a YouTube video about  this.

			- NOW I can make more videos, using these resources found on [Web technology for developers | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)

			- NOW You don't know series is a series on youtube that highlights on rarely used and advance web tools. Using [Web technology for developers | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) as a guide, make videos about all of these.

				- If you are a beginner, these series should 🤯. A veteran would be like yeah, I almost forgot about this 😲.

		- Make Array Consecutive 2: The solution expects the count of the missing values in the array
			- Me:  Reduce the array, taking the current value `c` and the next value `n` = `arr[i+1]` and an accumulator `o`:
			- ```ts
			  function solution(statues: number[]): number {
			   return statues.sort((a,b)=>a>b?1:a===b?0:-1).reduce((o, c, i, arr)=>{
			          return arr[i+1]? o += (arr[i+1]-1)-c:o;
			      }, 0);
			  }
			  
			  ```
			- Best Solution: This solution takes the difference `max` and `min+1` of the array to get the expected length
			  ```ts
			  function solution(statues: number[]): number {
			      return Math.max(...statues) - Math.min(...statues) + 1 - statues.length;
			  }
			  
			  ```
