- [[Dev Log]] #fleeting
	- project:: `graphql-code-generator`
	- Update:THe PR     was accepted and merged on ``. CharlyPoly requested that I provide some docs on the plugin. I have tested the plugin on the `asanwura-trash-save` project and it worked flawlessly
	- Challenges:
	- Proposed Solution:
		- Solution 1:
	- Objectives: What you intend on achieving
	- Research Notes:
- TODO:
	- LATER Svelta: my copy-paste component library which I recently upgraded to SvelteKit now  has the a new focus. #fleeting
		- It will be repurposed to become a UI framework on top of SvelteKit, that is data/event driven.
		- Under this new feature, one will jut describe a page with JSON or YAML and Svelta will do it magic. Just like how the TableBuilder and FormBuilder did it magic for the idelmis.now.sh app, this  new feature will allow a page to be configured, specifying how components would be placed in a grid of a page and done. This way you pages can be handled via a CRM and it could be dynamic as you want it for something like Event Sourcing or event driven micro-services... call it whatever
- DECK is powerful and high performant local web development studio unlike any other https://getdeck.io/docs/
	- But unfortunately there is no install package for Garuda/Arch linux
	- LATER Make a PKGBUILD setup for Arch Linux/Garuda for DECK
