	- Docker Desktop was stuck on starting, and so I tried following the docs which stated that the docker static binaries be used for ArchLinux. That fixed the issue for me.
	- But there was another thing left to do. The docker docs mentioned something about securing the static binaries with AppArmor and SELinux.
	- This lead me to discover a whole lot of tools to enhance security on Linux
	- [AppArmor](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AppArmor)
		- [AppArmor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor) is a [Mandatory Access Control](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mandatory_Access_Control) (MAC) system, implemented upon the [Linux Security Modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules) (LSM).
		- AppArmor, like most other LSMs, supplements rather than replaces the default Discretionary Access Control (DAC). As such it is impossible to grant a process more privileges than it had in the first place.
		- Ubuntu, SUSE and a number of other distributions use it by default. RHEL (and its variants) use SELinux which requires good userspace integration to work properly. SELinux attaches labels to all files, processes and objects and is therefore very flexible. However configuring SELinux is considered to be very complicated and requires a supported filesystem. AppArmor on the other hand works using file paths and its configuration can be easily adapted.
		- AppArmor proactively protects the operating system and applications from external or internal threats and even zero-day attacks by enforcing a specific rule set on a per application basis. Security policies completely define what system resources individual applications can access, and with what privileges. Access is denied by default if no profile says otherwise. A few default policies are included with AppArmor and using a combination of advanced static analysis and learning-based tools, AppArmor policies for even very complex applications can be deployed successfully in a matter of hours.
		- Every breach of policy triggers a message in the system log, and AppArmor can be configured to notify users with real-time violation warnings popping up on the desktop.
