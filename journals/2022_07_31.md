- Important discovery with the MTN Ghana app. #fleeting #bug #mtn-app #hacking #zero-day-exploit
	- The MTN app shows false information when you skip the first loading and proceed straight to purchase a bundle from your airtime. This cause 2 states to change: your remaining airtime balance and your new data bundle balance.
	- But because you skipped the first loading, the app becomes unstable after the first purchase. It won't let you make another purchase even if the USSD service `*124#` confirms that you have enough airtime.
		- This indicates that the USSD service and the mobile app don't work in sync. The USSD shows the source of truth while the app relies on some cache data/proxy server.
	- Refreshing, turning off the data, going on airplane mode, killing the app and restarting the app all doesn't help. I haven't tried removing the SIM and reinserting it but maybe that would work.
	- Plus: The app doesn't let you screen record it. It shows a black screen if you try to record it
- DONE Re-register all my SIM cards today
