  A GraphQL Union basically is a Freezed class where the Union name becomes the class name, while the types that makes up the union becomes named constructors in the Freezed class.
- Make the factorConstructor a map instead of a list. The Map will ObjectType or the InputType name as the key, and it FreezzedFactoryConstructorBlock as the value :X:
- A better alternative would be a FactoryConstructorRepository whose job would be to collect a map of ObjectType or the InputType name as the key, and it FreezzedFactoryConstructorBlock as the value
