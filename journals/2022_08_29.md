- # Blog: SvelteKit `svelte-kit, 1.0.0-next.445` Updates #fleeting #blog-post
	- title:: What's new in `svelte-kit, 1.0.0-next.445`
	  tags:: #lang-js #frameworks #svelte-kit #svelte #whats-new
	- SvelteKit is moving at the speed of sound to reach `v1.0.0` and hence the team is juggling between pressure from the community to publish features proposed in the RFC while early-adopters ran't about how the team is not giving them enough time to soak in the new changes.
	- >[!Tip] Please follow the [Discussions](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/) and read the  [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/05e8240150da446f6cd3c1f0feb4447408b2b43b/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md)  to stay updated on the breaking changes
	- ## What's Changed
		- (group) layout replaces named-layout [#6124](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/6124)
			- However, theses changes are aimed at make the framework more expressive and simple and that's what we all want and love about Svelte
			- [#6124](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/6124) in particular makes it very easy to avoid hacking named-layouts to break out of the inherited layout that  was released in `svelte-kit, 1.0.0-next.306`  [#4388](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4388). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/05e8240150da446f6cd3c1f0feb4447408b2b43b/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md#100-next306)
	- ## The Problem with Named Layouts
		- Named Layout allowed you to specify exactly which layout your `+page.svelte` and `+layout.svelte` files should inherit by appending `@name` where `@name` is the part of the layout file name between the `+layout-` and `.svelte` extension.
		- Example: a `+page.svelte` or `+layout.svelte` file that wishes to inherit from a layout with the name `+layout-settings`, would have to be renamed as `+page@settings.svelte` or `+layout@settings.svelte` respectively
		- Using folder structure:
			- ```tree
			  src/routes/
			  ├ /
			  ├ courses/
			  │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ └ +page.ts
			  ├ lecturers/
			  │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ └ +page.ts
			  ├ schedules/
			  │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ └ +page.ts
			  ├ settings/
			  │ ├ +page@settings.svelte
			  │ └ +page.ts
			  ├ login/
			  │ ├ +page@auth.svelte
			  │ └ +page.ts
			  ├ register/
			  │ ├ +page@auth.svelte
			  │ └ +page.ts 
			  ├ [deeplink=action]/
			  │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ ├ +page.ts
			  │ └ +layout@root.svelte
			  ├ +layout.svelte
			  ├ +layout-auth.svelte
			  ├ +layout-settings@default.svelte
			  └ +layout-root.svelte
			  ```
		- Will give us the following routes:
			- ```text
			  /
			  /courses
			  /lecturers
			  /schedules
			  /settings
			  /login
			  /register
			  /reset-password?email=parables95@gmail.com - deeplink
			  /verify-email?email=parables95@gmail.com - deeplink
			  /success?onboarding=done$redirectTo=home - deeplink
			  ```
		- Looking at the folder structure above:
			- the `/courses`, `/lecturers` and `/schedules` routes will inherit from the layout from `src/routes/+layout.svelte`
			- the `/settings` route will inherit from both the default parent layout `src/routes/+layout.svelte` and 
			   the `src/routes/+layout-settings.svelte` layout
			- likewise, the `/login` and `/register` routes will break out from the default parent layout `src/routes/+layout.svelte` and will rather inherit from the `src/routes/+layout-auth.svelte` layout
			- the deeplink routes will inherit from the immediate layout file `src/routes/[deeplink=action]/+layout@root.svelte` which in turn will also inherit from the named layout `src/routes/layout-root.svelte` since it explicitly specifies the `@root` in the layout name
			-
		- This layout hacking method will it makes it easy to infer the routes using the folder structure makes it a bit harder to understand where routes belongs to.
		- For example I would want to group `/courses`, `/lecturers` and `/schedules` under dashboard but if I create a new directory `src/routes/dashboard` and the routes into the dashboard directory, my routes becomes `/dashboard/courses`, `/dashboard/lecturers` and `/dashboard/schedules` and that's is not what I want. I want to keep them on the index level and not nest them in the `/dashbaord` level.
	- ## (group) layouts to the rescue
		- To address the problems posed by named-layouts, (group) layouts allows you to group your routes in a a special directory which is named in parenthesis `(dashboard)` to indicate that this directory is only meant for group layouts and hence it doesn't appear in the route's URL
		- Our new folder structure now becomes
			- ```tree
			  src/routes/
			  ├ (dashboard)/
			  │ ├ courses/
			  │ │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ │ └ +page.ts
			  │ ├ lecturers/
			  │ │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ │ └ +page.ts
			  │ ├ schedules/
			  │ │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ │ └ +page.ts
			  │ ├ settings/
			  │ │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ │ ├ +page.ts
			  │ │ └ +layout.svelte
			  │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ ├ +page.ts
			  │ └ +layout.svelte
			  ├ (auth)
			  │ ├ login/
			  │ │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ │ └ +page.ts
			  │ ├ register/
			  │ │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ │ └ +page.ts
			  │ └ +layout.svelte 
			  ├ (deeplink)	
			  │ ├ [deeplink=action]/
			  │ │ ├ +page.svelte
			  │ │ └ +page.ts
			  └ +layout.svelte
			  ```
		- Our directory now looks cleaner, and it is more easy to reason out where the layout belongs. Knowing that  any folder in parenthesis `()` wont, appear in the URL, one can easily read out the the route structure, by ignoring any (group) named folder in the hierarchy.
		- the `/courses`, `/lecturers`, `/schedules` and the `/settings` routes will all inherit from the layout from `src/routes/(dashboard)/+layout.svelte` as well as the `src/routes/+layout.svelte`
		- `/login` and `/register` will also inherit from `src/routes/(auth)/+layout.svelte` as well as the `src/routes/+layout.svelte`
		- While `src/routes/(dashboard)/+page.svelte` will be the index/homepage.
		- Remember, (dashboard) is ignored in the route hierarchy making  `src/routes/(dashboard)/+page.svelte` at the same level as `src/routes` so please keep that in mind before you throw another `+page.svelte` at the same level or else SvelteKit will crash and throw back at you a nice error message
		- ```log
		  Error:  and (dashbaord) occupy the same route
		  ```
		- Pages and layouts inside groups — as in any other directory — will inherit layouts above them, unless they *break out* of the layout hierarchy.
		- A page can break out of a layout by specifying the name of the folder that contains the layout file you want to inherit.
		- For example to beak the `/settings` route from inheriting from the `src/routes/(dashboard)/+layout.svelte` to rather inherit a parent layout above it like the root layout in `src/routes/+layout.svelte`, you can rename  `src/routes/(dashboard)/settings/+page.svelte` to `src/routes/(dashboard)/settings/+page@.svelte` where `@` represents the root layout in the hierarchy.
		- Also, if there are parent layouts in the hierarchy above that you want a page to break out of its current inheritance and inherit from parent layout, specify `@(parent-group)` or `@parent-folder`
		- To break out of the layout uses a similar convention as the page. Simply use `@` followed by the name of a folder above in the hierarchy where the layout you want to inherit is like `@(parent-group)` or `@parent-folder`.
		- A  `+layout@.svelte`  component would reset the hierarchy for all its child routes.
	- ## Migrate our SvelteKit app to use (group) layouts
		- Delete the `node_modules` folder and the `.sveltekit` and the `package-lock.json` or the `-lock` file for any package manager you are using
			- ```bash
			  rm -rf node_modules .sveltekit
			  rm package-lock.json # change it as per your package manager `pnpm` or `yarn`
			  ```
		- And reinstall the packages again using your preferred  package manager
			- ```bash
			  npm install
			  ```
		- This is necessary in order to ensure that you have the latest versions of the dependencies.
		- [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) `ncu` may not be helpful here so play it safe and reinstall all your dependencies
		- That is the cost you've to pay for rolling on the bleeding-edge
	- ## Conclusion
		- SveltKit is amazing and Rich-Harris and the team are making great improvements to make it more awesome.
		- We really appreciate them for everything they are doing to make out lives easier and simple as developers.
		- Seen a typo, noticed something wrong in the article, still confused, share your thoughts in the comment section below or find me on Svelte's Discord channel `@parables_boltnoel`
		- That's all for this post.
