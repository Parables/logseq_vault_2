- [[Dear Dairy]] Today, I finally accept that my relationship with Chris is over.
  collapsed:: true
	- This relationship started on March 12th, 2018, had the most memorable moment on March 5th, 2020 and came to an end on October 12th, 2022.
	- I still don't know why she broke up with me and replaced me with someone else. She won't tell me the name of her new boyfriend, all she said was "just keep this in mind that we are no longer together".
	- I have tried to get her back and she said "NO". If there is one thing I know about Chris, she is firm with her decisions. Her "YES" is really her yes, same goes for her no.
	- So today, I have decided to let her go for the following reasons:
		- She is avoiding me, not answering my calls, which hurts me more. Whenever she does that, it feels like she is puncturing holes into my heart draining it out of every drop of love. If this continues, I won't be able to love any lady again
		- I need to stop thinking about her and focus on my dreams and work hard to realise them. There is no need in crying over a spilled milk. I have to stop breathing life into something that is long gone.
		- I lost Chris simply because of one thing, money, if I had money, things would have turned out a bit different. We could have been married by now, living a happy life.
	- She is now with her boyfriend, and I guess she is happy. and that is what I want for her: "to be happy, always smiling and looking beautiful" so I should be happy for her and not lament over losing her. There is more to life that meets the eye. I wish her the best in life and more good days.
	- Even though she is no longer mine, if I remember her I would say a prayer for her.
	- I guess this is finally goodbye....
