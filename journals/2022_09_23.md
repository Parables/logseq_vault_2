- I am trying to expand a nested JSON object and pull out certain values to get a preferred structure
- This can be accomplished using AlaSQL
	- See: [alasql-seach-nested-json Â· GitHub](https://gist.github.com/Parables/0636ddedead14002da9b7921c4d8282b)

	- Explain the following snippets using the following keys
	- `/` loops over each element in the parent object
	- `@variable` store the current operation in the  `@variable` to be accessed later
	- `?` use as placeholders to be filled with the second argument passed after the string query to the `alasql()` function
	- `SEARCH` a special query keyword that allows one to traverse a graph object or a JSON object
	- `KEYS()` a `RETURN` modifier that only returns the keys in an object.
	- `EX($0->(_))` allows you to access the corresponding values for the `KEYS()` returned. This one is special to the top level root key's value.
	- `EX(@o->(_))` use this to access the values of `KEYS()` returned from an object stored in a variable `@o`. See syntax 2 below
	- `RETURN` keyword lets you defined the shape of then object returned for every result in the operation
	- `AS`  keyword specifies the key to use in the returned object
	- ```ts
	  // Syntax 1: 
	   
	  const result = alasql("SEARCH \
	  / AS @p \
	  outline AS @o \
	  / AS @y \
	  / AS @s \
	  / AS @c \
	  RETURN(\
	  @p->key AS key, \
	  @p->title AS title, \
	  @p->code AS code, \
	  @y AS year, \
	  @s AS sem, \
	  @c AS course \
	  ) FROM ?", [allProgrammes])
	  console.log(result);
	  ```
	- ```ts
	  // syntax 2:
	  
	  const result2 = alasql("SEARCH \
	  KEYS() EX($0->(_)) AS @p \
	  outline AS @o \
	  KEYS() AS @y EX(@o->(_)) AS @s \
	  KEYS() AS @sem EX(@s->(_)) \
	  / AS @course \
	  RETURN(\
	  @p->key AS key, \
	  @p->title AS title, \
	  @p->code AS code, \
	  @y AS year, \
	  @sem AS sem, \
	  @course AS course_id \
	  ) FROM ?", [allProgrammes])
	  console.log(result2);
	  ```
