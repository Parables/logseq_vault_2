- [[Dear Dairy]] I was curious to look up whether it is safe to download software from filecr.com
	- Found some Reddit post and most of them said they haven't had any issue with it. Along the lines, I found some post talking about [the arrest ofthe founders of Z library](https://torrentfreak.com/how-google-and-amazon-helped-the-fbi-identify-z-librarys-operators-221117/).
	- Apparently, there are other secured file sharing platforms I need to take a look into.
	- This Web3 thing is starting to get my attention,
	- LATER And heck, I need to get to the bottom of this cryptocurrency thing
