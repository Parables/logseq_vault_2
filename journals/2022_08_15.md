- [[Dev Log]] #fleeting
	- project:: `graphql-code-generator`
	- Update:THe PR     was accepted and merged on ``. CharlyPoly requested that I provide some docs on the plugin. I have tested the plugin on the `asanwura-trash-save` project and it worked flawlessly
	- Challenges: For some unknown reasons, I get errors when I add a `.mxd` to either the `guides` or `plugin` docs. I commented on this an attached the docs and asked @charlypoly to take a look it int for me.
- TODO:
	- LATER Svelta: my copy-paste component library which I recently upgraded to SvelteKit now  has the a new focus. #fleeting
		- It will be repurposed to become a UI framework on top of SvelteKit, that is data/event driven.
		- Under this new feature, one will jut describe a page with JSON or YAML and Svelta will do it magic. Just like how the TableBuilder and FormBuilder did it magic for the idelmis.now.sh app, this  new feature will allow a page to be configured, specifying how components would be placed in a grid of a page and done. This way you pages can be handled via a CRM and it could be dynamic as you want it for something like Event Sourcing or event driven micro-services... call it whatever
- DECK is powerful and high performant local web development studio unlike any other https://getdeck.io/docs/
  collapsed:: true
	- But unfortunately there is no install package for Garuda/Arch linux
	- LATER Make a [PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD) setup for Arch Linux/Garuda for DECK or check [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/)

  id:: 62fd13d6-2d67-422c-82c6-0cab8e446fdd
	- project:: `proophessor-do` tutorial
	- Update: I am taking a big step into how I build apps by using Event Sourcing(ES). I have been watching a lot of talks about ES and I think its about time. I will be reading the docs while looking at the implementation of `proophessor-do` so that I can gain deeper understanding. I will be documenting my progress here
	- Update 2:
		- For every web app, the best place to get started is the routes configuration to see what handles the request.
			- `config/routes.php` contains the route definitions. I wont talk much about the get routes as I have to do further investigation about how the submit button made the post request from the  `GET '/user-registration'` to `POST '/api/commands/register-user'` route.
			- But something interesting happens when handling the `POST '/api/commands/register-user'` request
			  id:: 62faacaf-77b4-40b8-a0b1-fbee7f3c066f
			  ```php
			      $app->post('/api/commands/register-user', [
			          \Prooph\ProophessorDo\Middleware\JsonPayload::class,
			          \Prooph\ProophessorDo\Middleware\JsonError::class,
			          \Prooph\HttpMiddleware\CommandMiddleware::class,
			      ], 'command::register-user')
			          ->setOptions([
			              'values' => [
			                  'prooph_command_name' => \Prooph\ProophessorDo\Model\User\Command\RegisterUser::class,
			              ],
			          ]);
			  ```
		- There are 3 middlewares that handles the `POST` request:
		- `\Prooph\ProophessorDo\Middleware\JsonPayload::class`:
			- This handles the incoming request first. It process the request,
				- checks if the request headers contains a `Content-Type` with the value `application/json`
				- extracts the payload by:
				  ```php
				   $payload = \json_decode((string) $request->getBody(), true)
				  ```
				- if the `json_decode` method doesn't throw any exceptions:
					- it injects the `payload` back into the request
					  ```php
					              $request = $request->withParsedBody(null === $payload ? [] : $payload);
					  ```
					- It then allows the request to pass through
					  id:: 62faaea1-dba4-460b-8f14-9022570230b1
					  ```php
					  return $handler->handle($request);
					  ```
				- otherwise throws a `RuntimeException`
				  ```php
				   switch (\json_last_error()) {
				                  case JSON_ERROR_DEPTH:
				                      throw new \RuntimeException('Invalid JSON, maximum stack depth exceeded.', 400);
				                  case JSON_ERROR_UTF8:
				                      throw new \RuntimeException('Malformed UTF-8 characters, possibly incorrectly encoded.', 400);
				                  case JSON_ERROR_SYNTAX:
				                  case JSON_ERROR_CTRL_CHAR:
				                  case JSON_ERROR_STATE_MISMATCH:
				                      throw new \RuntimeException('Invalid JSON.', 400);
				              }
				  ```
				-
		- `\Prooph\ProophessorDo\Middleware\JsonError::class`:
			- Any exceptions thrown by the `\Prooph\ProophessorDo\Middleware\JsonPayload::class` will be caught and handled here.
			- It first try to let the request pass through to the next handler and catches any exceptions that were  thrown
			  ```php
			   try {
			              return $handler->handle($request);
			          } catch (\Throwable $e) {
			              $contentType = \trim($request->getHeaderLine('Content-Type'));
			  
			              if ($e instanceof RuntimeException) {
			                  $e = $e->getPrevious();
			  
			                  if ($e instanceof MessageDispatchException) {
			                      $e = $e->getPrevious();
			                  }
			              }
			  
			              if (0 === \mb_strpos($contentType, 'application/json')) {
			                  $data = 'development' === \getenv('PROOPH_ENV')
			                      ? ['message' => $e->getMessage(), 'trace' => $e->getTraceAsString()]
			                      : ['message' => 'Server Error'];
			  
			                  return new JsonResponse($data, StatusCodeInterface::STATUS_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
			              }
			          }
			  ```
			- Since the `\Prooph\ProophessorDo\Middleware\JsonPayload::class` middleware may thrown a `RuntimeException`, it checks for that, and if true, it attempts to get the previous exception which may be thrown during the `json_decode` on the request body
			- After getting the exception, it then checks the `Content-Type` of the request and send a `JsonResponse`. It includes a `trace` field in the error response only if the application is in `development`
			-
		- `\Prooph\HttpMiddleware\CommandMiddleware::class`:
			- This is where the real magic ðŸª„ happens.
			- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
			  ((62faacaf-77b4-40b8-a0b1-fbee7f3c066f))
			  #+END_QUOTE 
			  
			  In the above reference, an option is set
			  ```php
			   ->setOptions([
			              'values' => [
			                  'prooph_command_name' => \Prooph\ProophessorDo\Model\User\Command\RegisterUser::class,
			              ],
			          ]);
			  ```
			- This is all the data that needs to be passed to the post endpoint, just tell it what command it should handle.
			- The `\Prooph\HttpMiddleware\CommandMiddleware::class`:
				- extracts the `commandName` from the request
				  ```php
				  $commandName = $request->getAttribute(self::NAME_ATTRIBUTE);
				  ```
				- or throws an error if the `null===commandName`
				  ```php
				  if (null === $commandName) {
				    throw new RuntimeException(
				      sprintf('Command name attribute ("%s") was not found in request.', self::NAME_ATTRIBUTE),
				      StatusCodeInterface::STATUS_BAD_REQUEST
				    );
				  }
				  ```
				- using the `commandName`, it fetches the command using the `MessageFactory $commandFactory`
				  ```php
				  $command = $this->commandFactory->createMessageFromArray($commandName, [
				    'payload' => $request->getParsedBody(),
				    'metadata' => $this->metadataGatherer->getFromRequest($request),
				  ]);
				  ```
					- NOW I will come back to the `MessageFactory` later @see: `vendor/prooph/common/src/Messaging/FQCNMessageFactory.php`
					  :LOGBOOK:
					  CLOCK: [2022-08-15 Mon 21:10:29]
					  :END:
				- it then dispatches the command
				  ```php
				  $this->commandBus->dispatch($command);
				  ```
				- and then response back with `STATUS_ACCEPTED = 202` response
				  ```php
				  return $this->responseStrategy->withStatus(StatusCodeInterface::STATUS_ACCEPTED);
				  ```
				-
				- To keep this log short but the logic for dispatching the command can be found @ `vendor/prooph/http-middleware/src/CommandMiddleware.php`
				- What the dispatch method basically does is:
					- finds the `$commandHandler` responsible for that command and executes it passing in the command, and sets `$actionEvent` to `true` if the command is handled successfully
					  ```php
					  $commandHandler = $actionEvent->getParam(self::EVENT_PARAM_MESSAGE_HANDLER);
					  
					  if (is_callable($commandHandler)) {
					    $command = $actionEvent->getParam(self::EVENT_PARAM_MESSAGE);
					    $commandHandler($command);
					    $actionEvent->setParam(self::EVENT_PARAM_MESSAGE_HANDLED, true);
					  }
					  ```
					- the `$command handler` can also fire other events which collected by the listener that was attached before executing the `$commandHandler`
					  ```php
					  $this->events->attachListener(
					    self::EVENT_DISPATCH,
					    function (ActionEvent $actionEvent): void {
					      $commandHandler = $actionEvent->getParam(self::EVENT_PARAM_MESSAGE_HANDLER);
					  
					      if (is_callable($commandHandler)) {
					        $command = $actionEvent->getParam(self::EVENT_PARAM_MESSAGE);
					        $commandHandler($command);
					        $actionEvent->setParam(self::EVENT_PARAM_MESSAGE_HANDLED, true);
					      }
					    },
					    self::PRIORITY_INVOKE_HANDLER
					  );
					  ```
					- See the full implementation here `vendor/prooph/service-bus/src/CommandBus.php`
					- If the command is not handled, a `RuntimeException` is thrown
					  ```php
					  if ($actionEvent->getParam(self::EVENT_PARAM_MESSAGE_HANDLER) === null) {
					    throw new RuntimeException(sprintf(
					      'CommandBus was not able to identify a CommandHandler for command %s',
					      $this->getMessageName($actionEvent->getParam(self::EVENT_PARAM_MESSAGE))
					    ));
					  }
					  ```
