- I will be attempting to redesign ICODE's website
- This is the 3rd attempt, the first was accepted but underwent so many modifications and eventually abandoned, the second one went to production but it was done in a rush, not something I am proud of.
- This 3rd attempt will have the same goals as the first, clean, minimal, smooth parallax effects, transitions and animations. Of course, the user can opt out by enabling `prefers-reduced-motion`
- I will be gathering inspiration across the internet.
