- Implement the following features in the FlutterFreezedPlugin
	- Custom `fromJson` and `toJson` functions to be applied globally or on a specific field of a specific GraphQL  Type. This can be useful in models where fields is not a scalar that can easily be converted like Firebase.serverTimestamp
	- ```dart
	  @JsonSerializable()
	  class Sample3 {
	    Sample3(this.value);
	  
	    factory Sample3.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>
	        _$Sample3FromJson(json);
	  
	    @JsonKey(
	      toJson: _toJson,
	      fromJson: _fromJson,
	    )
	    final DateTime value;
	  
	    Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$Sample3ToJson(this);
	  
	    static int _toJson(DateTime value) => value.millisecondsSinceEpoch;
	    static DateTime _fromJson(int value) =>
	        DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch(value);
	  }
	  ```
	- Support deserializing-generic-classes [freezed | Dart Package](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed#deserializing-generic-classes) to be added to the FreezedConfig options
	- Support Interfaces [freezed | Dart Package](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed#mixins-and-interfaces-for-individual-classes-for-union-types)
	- Create an expanded config file for plugin documentation. Name it something like `config-doc.ts`
	- Enums are camelCased by default using the `config.camelCasedEnums` option. This impose casing to only camelCase, some may prefer snake_case or PascalCase instead.
		- Change this behaviour in the config to work similar to `config.escapeDartKeywords`
