	- Update: For local development, I downloaded the assets of the GraphQL Playground. Everything works perfectly locally but the `graphql-playground` route in production throws `Mixed Content errors`
		- ```log
		  Mixed Content: The page at 'https://asa-nwura-backend.herokuapp.com/graphql-playground' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure stylesheet 'http://asa-nwura-backend.herokuapp.com/vendor/graphql-playground/index.css'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

		  graphql-playground:1 Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received

	- Challenges:
	- Proposed Solution: Investigating the `[graphql-playground]("mll-lab/laravel-graphql-playground": "^2.6")`, I realized that the assets were downloaded into the `public` directory and loaded from there
		- Solution 1: `gitignore` the `public/vendor/graphql-playground` so that it won't be available in production, causing it to load from the CDN
		- Replace the urls in the `resources/views/vendor/graphql-playground/index.blade.php` with the hardcoded URL, wrapped with Laravel's assets url helper method.
