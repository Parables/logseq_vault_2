- I recently reinstalled Garuda Linux because GRUB, which allows me to choose whether to boot into Windows or continue with Garuda was missing. With GRUB, my PC would just boot straight up into Windows.
- I tried using the LiveCD I used to reinstall to attempt fixing the GRUB. It didn't work.
- I read an article from itsFOSS and it showed me that the GRUB is not actually gone, but missing in the boot order
- I entered BIOS mode by pressing F2 repeatedly, immediately after powering up the system unit
- Then I navigated to Boot Options and added a New option.
- I clicked on the browse button `...` and went through each of the directories.
- The article suggested I use a `shimx` file but I didn't find it.
- I found a Garuda directory, opened it and found grub.e and selected that one.
- I named the new boot option and save the changes
- That's it. I was able to boot right back into my Garuda OS and immediately opened LogSeq to write this down.
