- [[Dev Log]] #fleeting
	- project:: simple-school-timetable
	- Update: Using Nhost for this project. The `nhost.auth.signUp()` method returned `session=null` and `error=null`.
		- Looking through the logs for the `nhost/hasura-auth:0.10.0` I found this error: `"No template found at /app/email-templates/en/email-verify/body.txt"`
		- ```json

		- ```bash
		  nhost version
		  > Nhost CLI v0.7.6 for linux-amd64
		  > You have the latest version. Hurray!

		- You can **bypass** email verification with the following changes to your `nhost-backend/nhost/config.yaml` file:
		- ```diff
		  auth:
		    access_control:
		      email:
		        allowed_email_domains: ""
		        allowed_emails: ""
		        blocked_email_domains: ""
		        blocked_emails: ""
		      url:
		        allowed_redirect_urls: ""
		    anonymous_users_enabled: false
		    client_url: http://127.0.0.1:5173
		    disable_new_users: false
		    email:
		      enabled: false
		      passwordless:
		        enabled: false
		  -    signin_email_verified_required: true
		  +    signin_email_verified_required: false
		      template_fetch_url: ""
		  ```
		- I commented on the discord server multiple times until Eli.. suggested I set the SMTP port from port: `1351` to `1025`
		- Before:
		- ```diff
		    smtp:
		      host: mailhog
		      method: ""
		      pass: password
		  -   port: 1351
		  +   port: 1025
		      secure: false
		      sender: hasura-auth@example.com
		      user: user
		  ```
	-
		- And with these changes, I was able to successfully send an email verification which was captured by `mailhog`
		- It wasn't easy but glad it worked. :relief:
	- Also working with the Nhost CLI offline requires you to set up your Nhost client as below:
	- ```ts
	  import { NhostClient } from '@nhost/nhost-js';
	  import { NHOST_SUBDOMAIN, NHOST_REGION, NHOST_BACKEND_URL } from '$env/static/private';
	  import { dev } from '$app/env';
	  
	  export const nhost = dev // local instance
	  	? new NhostClient({
	  			backendUrl: NHOST_BACKEND_URL, // 'http://localhost:1337'
	  			devTools: true
	  	  })
	  	: new NhostClient({ // cloud instance
	  			subdomain: NHOST_SUBDOMAIN,
	  			region: NHOST_REGION,
	  			devTools: true
	  	  });
	  
	  ```
