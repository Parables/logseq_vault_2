- Domain Driven Development
	- >Domain-Driven Design is an approach to software development that aims to **match the mental model** of the problem domain we're addressing.
	- `tl'dr`: The goals of DDD are as follows:
	  id:: 6345097f-3262-4923-8c94-929992a9099f
		- Discover the domain model by interacting with domain experts and agreeing upon a common set of terms to refer to processes, actors and any other phenomenon that occurs in the domain.
		- Take those newly discovered terms and embed them in the code, creating a rich domain model that reflects the actual living, breathing business and it's rules.
		- Protect that domain model from all the other technical intricacies involved in creating a web application.

	- > **Practise mindful breaths.** Use the four parts of the breath to bring you into the present. Inhale and bring everything in, then at the top of the breath with full lungs, consciously accept that it’s there. Then, as you exhale, let it all go until your lungs are completely empty of air. Before your next inhale, take a second to enjoy that everything is okay and you’re still you, regardless of what’s happening. The breath is very powerful in helping us think about what we’re taking in and what we’ll let go of.
	- >“ Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it. ” ― **Michelangelo**
	- >**Pay attention.** Our only role in this world is to be awake. Consciously do things to bring yourself into the moment. If you’re with someone and not paying attention, stop and zone in on that person and be with them fully. Start to eliminate background noises and sights until it’s just you and them. If this is difficult, while you’re alone, practise removing other senses so you begin to focus on one thing. Close your eyes for a minute and focus on a single noise or cover your ears and look at a single object.
	- >“ The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together. ” ― **Carl Sagan**
	- >“ If your life's work can be accomplished in your lifetime, you're not thinking big enough. ” ― **Wes Jackson**
	- >**Mindful living.** You've probably heard the old adage that life's too short to stuff a mushroom. But perhaps you should consider the opposite: that life's simply too short NOT to focus on the simple tasks. By slowing down and concentrating on basic things, you'll clear your mind of everything that worries you. Suggested reading: [The Power of Now](https://www.pdfdrive.com/the-power-of-now-a-guide-to-spiritual-enlightenment-e60365106.html)
	- >“ The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough. ” ― **Rabindranath Tagore**
	- >**Be aware of your connection to the universe.** Live with the awareness that everything you are end everything you do directly or indirectly affects everything and everyone around you. Small or big, what you choose to do can alter the course or destiny of living or non-living things that come your way. As you realize this, you will take more responsibility for your actions and influence, and will never take spiritual things lightly.
