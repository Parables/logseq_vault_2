	- During my quest, I remembered that Gregory Young did recommend that Event Sourcing works best with Functional Programming so I decided to take a peek into Funtional Programming #fp.
	- I started the detour by first exploring some of the #fp languages out there:
	- List of Functional Programming Languages #fp
		- Source: https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/functional-programming-languages/
		- The 🌟 rating is my experience level and personal preference for the language
		- Clojure #lang-clojure 🌟
		- Elixir  #lang-elixir 🌟
		- Haskell #lang-haskell 🌟
		- Scala #lang-scala
		- Python #lang-python 👎🏾 Reason???: It is a dynamic language, I really hate the indenting thing
		- Elm #lang-elm 🌟
		- F# 👎🏾  Reason???: From Microsoft and I have a strong beef with Microsoft
		- Erlang #lang-erlang 🌟
		- PHP #lang-php 🌟🌟🌟
		- Javascript #lang-js 👎🏾  Reason???: It is a dynamic language
		- Java 👎🏾 Reason???: bulky... I have to write more codes
		- C++ 👎🏾  Reason???: to low level for my taste, a lot of gotchas
		- Idris
		- Scheme
		- Go #lang-go 🌟
		- Rust #lang-rust 🌟
		- Kotlin #lang-kotlin
		- C# #lang-csharp 👎🏾  Reason???: From Microsoft and I have a strong beef with Microsoft
		- TypeScript #lang-ts 👎🏾 Reason???: From Microsoft, lacks sound types
		- ReasonML now ReScript #lang-reason-ml #lang-rescript
		- PureScript #lang-pure-script 🌟
		- Swift #lang-swift
	- All the #fp languages starred above looks promising enough and really caught my attention
	- I currently want to adopt Event Sourcing as my primary approach to building apps and I am looking forward to doing so with any of the languages above.
	- With these apps to build, I am looking forward to at least try out some of the tagged #fp languages:
		- asanwura: #lang-php with prooph-components
		- digimark  #lang-php with Spatie's event-sourcing package
		- cocms #lang-clojure
		- pendwn #lang-clojure #lang-dart #lang-go #lang-php #lang-rust #lang-rescript #lang-elm #lang-erlang
		- app-chef: not decided yet
		-
	- Spatie.be's Event Sourcing package was created with Laravel in mind hence it abstracts all the complexity involved. But I would have to compare that with prooph's laravel compnents
-
	- Features that I am looking for in theses languages
		- Strong sound typing. I simply hate dynamic typing. This automatically rules out #lang-python and #lang-js
		- The language must impress me and be easy for total beginners to easily comprehend since I will use them in open source projects
		- Must be easy to write tests and good editor tooling with debugging
		- Strong ecosystem but that it not a key factor provided the language itself is easy to use
