	- project:: [graphql-code-generator/flutter-freezed](https://github.com/Parables/graphql-code-generator/tree/flutter-freezed) plugin
	- Update: Most of the config options have been implemented. Added 2 passing tests. More tests are being added from the typescript validation plugin.
	- Challenges: The PR hasn't been reviewed yet, so I have to publish the plugin as a stand-alone package. The previous implementation involved me writing a CLI with `typed-cli`. But adding a custom CLI is an overkill because `graphql-code-generator` already includes a CLI.
	- Proposed Solution:
		- Solution 1: A bash script that would forward all arguments passed to it to `graphql-codegen`. This bash script must be executable and set as the `bin` in the `package.json`.
	- Objectives: What you intend on achieving
