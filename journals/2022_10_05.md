- Install Docker Desktop for Arch Linux
  id:: 633e8b89-271d-4f42-b138-d0f65508dbc4
	- In this video, I will guide you in a step by step manner to install Docker Desktop for Arch Linux.
	- DD, Docker Desktop is in an experimental stage for Arch so expect some few issues here and there but if I have done so can you.
	- If you don't know what docker is, I highly recommend that you look that up on the internet.
	- And if you are wondering why you need DD, I have a link to the docs where you can read more about the features that DD offers.
	- Basically, DD is a GUI for Docker, it has been available for Windows and Mac for some time now and finally Linux user have a chance to enjoy a nice GUI.
	- Not all Linux users are big fans of the terminals, this should explain why I use one of the most beautiful Linux Distros, Garuda Lnux. Link in the description below.
	- Okay, the docs has almost everything you need to install DD but there are some few gotchas which I will supplement with other resources, so let head over there.
	- Before you begin, I highly recommend that you nuke you existing docker installation
	- Why? you ask. because Docker Desktop for Arch Linux requires that you use the static binaries of the docker client.
	- So go ahead and `sudo pacman -Rsu docker` and let's begin
	- Step 1: ((633d0fca-3737-413e-a91e-a118c7ca10ee))
	- Step 2: Install QEMU, I did the full installation, but I think you can get away with the `qemu-base` version
	- Step 3: Install the Docker static client libraries, simply download the compressed file, unzip it and copy it to the `/usr/bin` directory
	- Step 4: Download docker Desktop, and use `sudo pacman -U <downloaded file>` to install Docker Desktop
	- That's it... I hope you found this video helpful. If you have any issues, leave your comments below, if you enjoyed this video, show some love and like this video and do subscribe to this channel, cause there is more from where that came from.

- Personality Test
	- I opened my my email and was surprised Amalitech had sent me an email requesting that I take a personality test.
	- I found myself laughing out loud as the results spoke volumes about my personality.
		- ‚ÄúMaybe I could‚Ä¶fly helicopters¬†*and*¬†be an oceanographer who writes songs and cooks?‚Äù.... that's definitely me üòÑ
		- Although they benefit from a degree of structure and accountability, they may lose steam in work environments that rely on strict regimentation and hierarchy.
		- Any job that expects them to keep quiet and follow protocol is effectively turning two of Campaigners‚Äô greatest strengths into liabilities.
		- With their enthusiasm and empathy, these personalities can turn each workday into an opportunity to learn something new and make the world just a little better ‚Äì and they wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.
		- People with this personality type are happy to experiment with new ways of doing things and to change course when necessary. They also stand out as excellent listeners, always eager to consider other people‚Äôs perspectives.
		- Campaigners are notorious for skipping ahead to a new project before they‚Äôve completed the last one.
		- They love exploring new endeavors, but once a project‚Äôs allure begins to fade, they may find it difficult to stay motivated. In this spirit, Campaigners may find it helpful to view check-ins from their bosses as accountability and encouragement ‚Äì in other words, teamwork ‚Äì rather than micromanagement.

	- The test placed my identity under a microscope and highlighted everything about me.
	- Heck, it even proved why I was so much fond of Robert Downey, Jr. (Iron Man).
	- The results are available here: [Parables Boltnoel - Assertive Campaigner (ENFP-A)  | 16Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/7234f25db7b13)
	- NOW I have to let Chris take this test and see how compatible we are with each other.
