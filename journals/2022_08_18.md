	- In my quest to figure out which functional programming language to adopt for my future projects, I landed on a lot of opinions on the internet.

	- After lots of digging through the links above, reading a variety of opinions from various forums and surveys, I finally decided that  it is worth learning Clojure but I will go with Haskell over Clojure for these reasons: #lang-haskell #lang-clojure
		- Haskell is strongly typed, Clojure is dynamic
		- Haskell is more readable compared to Clojure
		- Clojure uses JVM, I just want to avoid the whole Java ecosystem all together

	- These reasons are enough to compel me to stick with Haskell
